# Creative Commons history timeline

A timeline telling the story of the Creative Commons organization and worldwide movement.

## How it works

This project uses the awesome MPL-licensed [TimelineJS storytelling platform](https://timeline.knightlab.com/) built by Northwestern University's Knight Lab. If you look at `index.html`, you'll note that it's just an `iframe` embed.

The timeline is driven by data published in [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQTja1lckMV2SgddhK0mdkxH3HGGq5d00jIiSFMyQT76fcNBYEaxx6Y3DAJD2VkUdArRh2HO85kNrLz/pubhtml).
